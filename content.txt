## Change of variable

Let $\boldsymbol{X}$ be a random vector and consider 

:::

:::{#exm-change-variable-lognormal}

If $Y \sim \mathsf{normal}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $g(Y) = \log Y$ has density
\begin{align*}
f_{g(Y)}(y) = \frac{1}{\sigma}\phi\left(\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma}\right)
\end{align*}

Taylor series and Newton-Raphson 












Subjective probability [@Villani:2023]

Bayes formula (example with Covid rapid tests, sensitivity vs specificity) +  Bayesian updating
Posterior distribution reflects our lack of knowledge of parameters

What changes in a Bayesian analysis? Posterior distribution and summary.
The object of inference is the whole distribution, from which we can extract any summary of interest or draw samples.

Hypothesis testing? Marginal likelihood and Bayes factors for model comparison (dos and dont's)

Comparing posterior median, mode and mean (watch out for correlated samples)

High posterior density regions and credible intervals + rant about 95%



Posterior predictive distribution: example with a linear regression model and Student-t predictions


Why bother? insights gained from using the Bayesian approach, uncertainty quantification and computational challenges. Extensions to hierarchical models.

Application: Canadian wildfire counts and area burnt

Example derivation: [dynamic linear model, hidden Markov model and Kalman recursions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Relationship_to_recursive_Bayesian_estimation)

# 2: Priors

Arbitrariness of both the prior and the likelihood

Likelihood principle

May be chosen due to mathematical convenience (e.g., conjugacy)

Units, scaling and standardized priors

gamma/Poisson model with A/B testing, hierarchical linear model with half-t prior

Prior elicitation may require [expert knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01380).


Quantile priors of [Coles and Tawn](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2986068) (using `revdbayes`)

Setting parameters of priors is often done by reparametrizing the latter in terms of moments 

Example with beta prior

Are my priors reasonable? Use prior predictive distribution to assess the plausibility
comparing prior to posterior standard deviations, e.g., Nott et al. (2020)

Example: simple linear regression slope (height/weight) of Figure 4.5 in McElreath

Priors are not invariant to reparametrization and Jeffrey's prior


Improper priors may lead to improper posterior: stick with proper distributions unless you know what you are doing

Penalized complexity prior

Maximum domain information

Sensivity analysis and asymptotic effect

Consensus of opinion: expert opinion and mixture
