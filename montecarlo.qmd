There are two major approaches to handling the problem of the unknown normalizing constant: deterministic and stochastic approximations. The former includes Laplace and nested Laplace approximations, variational methods and expectation propagation. This chapter covers the latter, stochastic approximations, and focuses on implementation of basic Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The simulation algorithms circumvent the need to calculate the normalizing constant of the posterior entirely. We present several examples of implementations, several tricks for tuning and diagnostics of convergence.
