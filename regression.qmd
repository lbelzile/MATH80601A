# Regression models

This chapter is dedicated to the case of generalized linear regression models. Starting with Gaussian data, we investigate the link between frequentists approaches to regularization and shrinkage priors. We also look at hierarchical models with mixed effects.

## Gaussian ordinary linear regression with conjugate priors

We consider regression models with model or design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ and an associated vector of regression coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p)^\top$ which describe the mean and act as weights for each covariate vector. In the ordinary linear regression model
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{Y} \mid \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2 \sim \mathsf{Gauss}_n(\beta_0\mathbf{1}_n + \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}_n),
\end{align*}
so that observations are independent and homoscedastic. Inference is performed conditional on the observed covariate vectors $\mathbf{X}_i$. The intercept $\beta_0$, which is added to capture the mean response and make it mean-zero, receives special treatment.


The conjugate prior for the Gaussian regression model for the mean and variance parameters is a Gaussian-inverse gamma (also listed as Gaussian-inverse $\chi^2$) and is defined hierarchically as
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\beta} \mid \sigma^2 &\sim \mathsf{Gauss}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_0, \sigma^2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}_0^{-1}) \\
\sigma^2 &\sim \mathsf{inv. gamma}(\nu_0/2, \nu\sigma^2_0/2).
\end{align*}


Then the conditional and marginal posterior distributions
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\beta} \mid \sigma^2, \boldsymbol{y}, \mathbf{X} &\sim \mathsf{Gauss}_p(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2\boldsymbol{\Omega}^{-1})  \\
\sigma^2 \mid  \boldsymbol{y}, \mathbf{X} \sim \\
\boldsymbol{\beta} \mid  \boldsymbol{y}, \mathbf{X} \sim \mathsf{Student}(\boldsymbol{\mu},  \sigma^2\boldsymbol{\Omega}^{-1}, \nu_0 + n)
\end{align*}

The improper prior $p(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2) \propto \sigma^{-2}$ can be viewed as a special case when
